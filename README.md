# deploy-freenas

deploy-freenas.py is a Python script to deploy TLS certificates to a FreeNAS/TrueNAS (Core) server using the FreeNAS/TrueNAS API.  This should ensure that the certificate data is properly stored in the configuration database, and that all appropriate services use this certificate.  It's intended to be called from a Let's Encrypt client like [acme.sh](https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh) after the certificate is issued, so that the entire process of issuance (or renewal) and deployment can be automated.

# Installation
This script can run on any machine running Python 3 that has network access to your FreeNAS/TrueNAS server, but in most cases it's best to run it directly on the FreeNAS/TrueNAS box.  Change to a convenient directory and run `git clone https://github.com/danb35/deploy-freenas`.

# Usage

The relevant configuration takes place in the `deploy_config` file.  You can create this file either by copying `depoy_config.example` from this repository, or directly using your preferred text editor.  Its format is as follows:

```
[deploy]
password = YourReallySecureRootPassword
cert_fqdn = foo.bar.baz
connect_host = baz.bar.foo
verify = false
privkey_path = /some/other/path
fullchain_path = /some/other/other/path
protocol = https://
port = 443
ftp_enabled = false
s3_enabled = false
```

Everything but `password` (or `api_key`) is optional, and the defaults are documented in `depoy_config.example`.

On TrueNAS (Core) 12.0 and up you should use API key authentication instead of password authentication.
[Generate a new API token in the UI](https://www.truenas.com/docs/hub/additional-topics/api/#creating-api-keys) first, then add it as `api_key` to the config, which replaces the `password` field:
```
api_key = 1-DXcZ19sZoZFdGATIidJ8vMP6dxk3nHWz3XX876oxS7FospAGMQjkOft0h4itJDSP
```

Once you've prepared `deploy_config`, you can run `deploy_freenas.py`.  The intended use is that it would be called by your ACME client after issuing a certificate.  With acme.sh, for example, you'd add `--deploy-hook "/path/to/deploy_freenas.py"` to your command.

There is an optional paramter, `-c` or `--config`, that lets you specify the path to your configuration file. By default the script will try to use `deploy_config` in the script working directoy:

```
/path/to/deploy_freenas.py --config /somewhere/else/deploy_config
```
