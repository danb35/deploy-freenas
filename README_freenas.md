# deploy-freenas

deploy_freenas.py is a Python script to deploy TLS certificates to a FreeNAS/TrueNAS (Core) server using the FreeNAS/TrueNAS API.  This should ensure that the certificate data is properly stored in the configuration database, and that all appropriate services use this certificate.  Its original intent was to be called from a Let's Encrypt client like [acme.sh](https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh) after the certificate is issued, so that the entire process of issuance (or renewal) and deployment can be automated.  However, it can be used with certificates from any source, whether a different ACME-based certificate authority or otherwise.

Since this script was developed, acme.sh has added a [deployment script](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/deployhooks#25-deploy-the-cert-on-truenas-core-server) which can deploy newly-issued certs to your TrueNAS system, so you may not need this script.  However, it isn't clear whether the acme.sh deployment script handles the services covered by this script (S3, FTP, WebDAV, Apps for SCALE).

# Installation
This script can run on any machine running Python 3 that has network access to your FreeNAS/TrueNAS server, but in most cases it's best to run it directly on the FreeNAS/TrueNAS box.  Change to a convenient directory and run `git clone https://github.com/danb35/deploy-freenas`.

If you're not running this script on your Free/TrueNAS server itself, you'll need to make sure that the Python `requests` module is available (it's there by default in Free/TrueNAS).  How you'll do that will depend on the OS you're using wherever you're running the script.

# Usage

The relevant configuration takes place in the `deploy_config` file.  You can create this file either by copying `deploy_config_freenas.example` from this repository, or directly using your preferred text editor.  Its format is as follows:

```
[deploy]
password = YourReallySecureRootPassword
cert_fqdn = foo.bar.baz
connect_host = baz.bar.foo
verify = false
privkey_path = /some/other/path
fullchain_path = /some/other/other/path
protocol = https://
port = 443
ui_certificate_enabled = false
s3_enabled = false
ftp_enabled = false
webdav_enabled = false
apps_enabled = false
apps_only_matching_san = false
cert_base_name = letsencrypt
```

Everything but `password` (or `api_key`) is optional, and the defaults are documented in `deploy_config.example`.

On TrueNAS (Core) 12.0 and up you should use API key authentication instead of password authentication.
[Generate a new API token in the UI](https://www.truenas.com/docs/hub/additional-topics/api/#creating-api-keys) first, then add it as `api_key` to the config, which replaces the `password` field:
```
api_key = 1-DXcZ19sZoZFdGATIidJ8vMP6dxk3nHWz3XX876oxS7FospAGMQjkOft0h4itJDSP
```

Once you've prepared `deploy_config`, you can run `deploy_freenas.py`.  The intended use is that it would be called by your ACME client after issuing a certificate.  With acme.sh, for example, you'd add `--reloadcmd "/path/to/deploy_freenas.py"` to your command.

There is an optional paramter, `-c` or `--config`, that lets you specify the path to your configuration file. By default the script will try to use `deploy_config` in the script working directoy:

```
/path/to/deploy_freenas.py --config /somewhere/else/deploy_config
```
